# Apple Data Analysis using PySpark

## Project Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to analyze customer transactions related to Apple products using **Apache Spark** in the **Databricks** environment.  
The primary goal is to process and transform raw data to derive actionable insights into **customer purchasing patterns**, product performance, and key business metrics.

## Key Features
- **ETL Pipelines**: Designed pipelines to address business questions related to Apple product purchases.  
- **Factory Design Pattern**: Implemented flexible and reusable `extractors`, `transformers`, and `loaders` for scalable data processing.  
- **Data Processing**: Handles multiple file formats including **CSV, Parquet, and Delta** using PySpark.  
- **Data Analysis**: Computes critical metrics such as:  
  - Customer purchase sequences  
  - Average time between purchases  
  - Top-selling products by revenue

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark / PySpark** – Distributed data processing framework  
- **Databricks** – Cloud-based data analytics environment  
- **Delta Lake** – Unified data storage and management

## Setup and Installation

### Databricks Setup
1. Create a cluster in **Databricks**.  
2. Upload the required datasets (`customer.csv`, `products.csv`, `transactions.csv`) to **DBFS**.  
3. Import the provided Python files (`.py`) as notebooks in the Databricks workspace.  

### Running the Project
1. Ensure all notebooks are uploaded and available in Databricks.  
2. Execute the main analysis notebook: `AppleAnalysisMainCode.py` to run the ETL pipelines.  
3. Processed results will be stored in **DBFS** or **Delta tables**, as defined by the loaders.

## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `customer.csv` | Customer information (IDs, demographics, registration dates) |
| `products.csv` | Product details (IDs, categories, prices) |
| `transactions.csv` | Transaction records (customer ID, product ID, purchase timestamp, revenue) |

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **customer churn prediction** and **lifetime value analysis**.  
- Integrate **interactive dashboards** using Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit.  
- Support **real-time data ingestion** via streaming sources (Kafka).  
- Include **unit tests and data validation checks** for pipeline robustness.  
- Optimize **performance** using partitioning, caching, and broadcast joins in Spark.
